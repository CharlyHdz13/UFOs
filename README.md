# UFOs
## Overview of the Project
The goal of the project is to build a webpage containing a huge amount of information of UFO sightings. By delivering them in a table which can be filtered via various types of filters.

## Results
When the user enters the webpage he is welcomed with the following:

At the top we have the navigation bar, where the user can click on the "UFO Sightings" text and the filters will be cleared and the table restored. Below we have the header of the webpage, then beneath that on the left side the title of the parragraph and on the right the parragraph with the introduction to the website and UFOs. Finally at the bottom of the page we have on the left the filter serch table with the different filters that can be used to filter the table on the right.

To use the filters, the user only needs to type inside the box the information that he wants and type enter and the table will be filtered.

Many filters can be applied to the table.

And if a filter is entered and there is no data that matches such criteria then the table will be restored

In the previous example there are no data that matches "mx" inside the country category. Also a message is displayed inside the console.
